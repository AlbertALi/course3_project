# Code Book

## Description
This code book decribe the components of the 2 tidy data sets in "tidy_data.txt" and "tidy_summary.txt".
The 2 data sets have same numbers of columns and same attributes.

Activity.name: 
1 represents WALKING
2 represents WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 represents WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 represents SITTING
5 represents STANDING
6 represents LAYING

## Subject
"subject": 1 to 30
